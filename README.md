As we can see in the table above, the most of the employees getting retired occupies senior roles which could be considered logic because of the time they have been working.

Employees with low to mid-range roles like: Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader and Assistant Engineer sums up 32,728. this is something expected as not every employee gets to develop the skills needed to get to the next level or simply they found themselves comfortable at an intermediate responsibility role.

There are only two Mabagers retiring, this is an interesting fact to take into consideration asi it could imply that elder employees are not being taken into consideration for management roles.

The number of elegible employees for mentorship program is 1,549. The list with employee information is available in the mentorship_elegibility.csv file.

## Summary

There are in total 90,398 employees in retirement age. 

- Pewlett Packard now can develop a strategy for new talent attraction based in the inputs that they now possess.
